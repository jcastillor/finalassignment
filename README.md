# Final Assignment

This repo is part of the final assignment needed for the Getting and Cleaning Data course by the JHU at Coursera.
Every analysis needed in order to complete this task is done within the `run_analysis.R`.

The rule of thought for this particular task has been to make it as simple as possible. No additional functions or subroutines have been used that are outside the main script, being the dplyr package the only library used.
